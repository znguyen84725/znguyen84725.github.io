			<h2>Music In My Years:</h2>   
				<p>When I was young, my parents paid for piano lessons for me around the time when I was about 6 years old.  My parents also paid for guitar and violin lessons for me.  I learned these musical instruments in this order:    
			
			<li> Piano, Guitar, Viola, Violin
			</li> 
				<p>To play the violin, one must practice for years before they can master it.  It is one of the most difficult instruments of all time.  This is due to a lot of factors: Correct Bowing, Technique, and Musical Inclination.</p>

			<p>It took me about 6 years to get to the level of violin that I am currently at.  If I had practiced more however, I am confident that I would be even more skilled in music than I am currently.  Music to me is a form of self-expression.  I think that music soothes all depression and purges all terrible thoughts from one's mind.
